# Inverse-Matrix-Multiplication-Using-OPENMP-and-MPI

This Project includes the Inverse Matrix Multiplication using Gaussian Elimination Method. It is implemented in both OPENMP & MPI. The results of both methods are compared in order to check which method takes lesser time than the other.
I have complete report on the results of these methods. If you are interested, then email me:
